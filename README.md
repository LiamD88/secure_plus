# UX

The design of the site isn't overly complicated, most pages are easy to navigate and laid out in a way for any user to find what they are looking for. The colour scheme is mainly black and an off white colour for text. The images on the pages being the brightest thing to see along with some of the submit buttons being a more stand out blue colour.

On the services page the options to purchase have a hover effect when you move the mouse over them to bring more animation to the site.

## User Stories
---
The site is aimed at commercial entities and I wanted to make it as simple as possible to navigate through the site. Below are some user stories.

1. As a multinational corporation with over 1000 staff cyber security is very important to us. I found this website quite easy to navigate, I like that they have a lot of the services offered but I think the main thing that stands out for me is they have an option to click a contact page and contact them about any other services I might need, so they can tailor a package to suit my needs. I will require this due to the fact I have so many staff.

2. As a small business owner I am not very computer literate and I want somebody to help me with everything about internet security as a lot of business is online these days. I have recently had a huge issue with a virus in the IT infrastructure of my business, I want to be able to go on here and have a complete overhaul. I see they have a package here for a comprehensive check of our systems, this is exactly what  I need.

3. As a graphic designer I do all of my work on my laptop and I want to ensure I am protected against any cyber threats because if something happens with this laptop I will be unable to work. Money is tight, a lot of companies don't display prices for this type of thing without contacting them first. I want to be able to see prices before approaching the company, this website has 3 main prices displayed and I think I will go for the monthly option.

4. As a student I want to have some sort of protection against cyber threats on my laptop to protect my work. I want a full list of all benefits and everything completely laid out when I look through this site. Upon searching through services I can see they have some of the main benefits noted down but not all as this is more geared towards commercial entities and it looks like they will contact you after to get everything set up. This site is not for me as I am not a commercial business.

5. As a business owner just starting out costs are tight at the moment and it would suit me to have an option to pay on a short term basis. When searching for costs I see they have a monthly option which suits me and I will go for this.

* [Postgres SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) The is the database I used for my project and linked with heroku to store and access information of the models used.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) This was used with bootstrap to allow you to place certain elements and functionality on your page.
 * [GitHub](https://github.com/) This allowed me to upload my local repository onto a remote server which was linked to Heroku to build which would push the latest changes to the version which was then built on Heroku.
 * [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) This is a site which allows you to deploy this type of application.
 * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) I used this as my ide to build my project. The local repository along with all my code was stored here.
* [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) Travis was used to ensure project was building successfully.
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ie) Stripe was used to process the payment on my site.

# Testing

[TESTING.md](https://github.com/LiamD88/secure_plus/blob/master/TESTING.md)This is a link to the testing done on this website.

# Issues/Bugs

* The parallax 1 image doesn't resize correctly on ipads when being scaled down.
* The registration form sometimes will not register details correctly if you just press enter on the keyboard as opposed to just clicking the submit button. Registration form can sometime have an issue if I use the same name in password as my email or username it won't register.
* On the home page, the two parallax images have an id of img1. I understand you can only have one id per element. In my extra.js file I added in img 1 + img 2 for this function to target both parallax images. However when I change the id in parallax2 to img 2 in my home.html file it doesnt work and when I remove the + img 2 from my extra.js file it only targets one image. This is the only way I could get it to work.
* In the contact app in views.py file the contact function I had an issue with send_mail. I had to create a generic email to place in here for emails to be sent to as when I tried to import the original from my env.py file it wouldnt work. Even importing from settings etc this was the only way I could get this to work.

# Deployment

This project was created with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) an external IDE not used on the course.
In order to deploy the project I have listed the steps I have taken below.

* The code was written in my local repository on VS code.
* A repository was created in Github for the project.
* The project was then linked from my local repository to github to allow the code to be stored remotely.
* An app was then created in heroku and under the deploy tab, you can enter your github repository link into this section to connect both repositories.
* In this section you can enable automatic deploys which allows you to automatically deploy a heroku build each time you update your github repository.
* The app was then available via a clickable link on the heroku site.

If you wish to deploy locally and clone the repository. To do this you would:

* Go to the main page of the github repository and click clone/download, this will be located under the repository name.
* In the section clone with HTTPS copy the clone URL and open the terminal on your IDE.
* Change the working directory to the location you wish your cloned directory to be placed.
* Type git clone and paste in your URL you had copied earlier.
* Now press enter and your clone will be created.
